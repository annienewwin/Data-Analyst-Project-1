Thank you for checking out my number guessing game! Let me tell you a little bit of what it does. I do not want to spoil too much of the fun now.

Upon starting the game, you will be welcomed to the game, given instructions, and asked for a value. As you continue your guess, the game will assist you in getting closer to the randomized value. Once your guess has matched the randomized value, you will be presented the amount of attempts it took you to get the match, your stats (Mean, Median, and Mode), and you will be asked if you want to play again.

If you choose to play again, you will see your 'best score' which is the lowest value of attempts you took to get the guess correct. Then, you will proceed with the game as explained above. 

If you do not want to play again, you will need to enter the given response selection, and the game will end with a message.
